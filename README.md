# Deploy-in-AWS-environment-through-Python
Deploy an AWS environment through Python, updating software and files using a pipeline 

To deploy an AWS environment through Python, updating software and files using a pipeline (one for Windows and another for Ubuntu Linux), we can utilize AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CloudFormation. This Python script can automate the setup of a CodePipeline, which will use AWS CodeDeploy for the deployment of Windows and Ubuntu Linux EC2 instances.

Below is an example of how to use Python and the boto3 library to achieve this. We'll define the CloudFormation templates in YAML format, set up the deployment pipelines, and define the necessary resources (such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets for artifacts, and IAM roles).

Steps:
Create the CloudFormation YAML templates for both Windows and Ubuntu Linux EC2 instances.
Set up an S3 bucket for storing deployment artifacts (e.g., software, configuration files).
Set up AWS CodePipeline for continuous delivery.
Set up CodeDeploy for deploying to Windows and Ubuntu Linux EC2 instances.


Key Components:
S3 Bucket for Artifacts:

The script creates an S3 bucket (BUCKET_NAME) to store deployment artifacts.

You should upload your application files (e.g., your-code.zip) into the S3 bucket.

CloudFormation Stack:

CloudFormation is used to launch Windows and Ubuntu EC2 instances.

The templates (windows-instance.yaml and ubuntu-instance.yaml) are deployed using CloudFormation.

CodeDeploy:

We create a CodeDeploy Application to manage the deployment.

A Deployment Group is set up to target the EC2 instances with specific tags (e.g., instances named Windows-EC2-Instance for Windows and Ubuntu-EC2-Instance for Ubuntu).

CodePipeline:

We create a CodePipeline to automate the deployment process, with stages for source and deployment.

The source stage pulls artifacts from the S3 bucket (your-code.zip), and the deploy stage uses CodeDeploy to deploy the application.

Setup Notes:
IAM Roles:

Ensure you have created IAM roles for CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, and EC2 instances (with appropriate permissions to interact with CodePipeline and CodeDeploy).

AMI IDs:

Replace the ImageId in the CloudFormation templates with valid AMI IDs for your region (for Windows and Ubuntu).

S3 Bucket:

Replace your-s3-bucket-for-artifacts with your actual S3 bucket name.

Security Groups:

Replace your-security-group with the security group that allows necessary ports (e.g., SSH for Ubuntu, RDP for Windows).

Execution:
This Python script automates the deployment process by creating the necessary CloudFormation stacks, CodeDeploy applications, and pipelines.
